# Clausal syntax


Word order is S V O. To wit:

| | | |
| | | |
| Dji | di | djre |
| leopard | eat |monkey |




'The leopard eats the monkey'


| | | |
| | | |
|Djre|di|dji|
|monkey|di|leopard|


'The monkey eats the leopard'



Some verbs trigger special suffixation on the undergoer:

| | | |
| | | |
|Dji|weŋiɛ|djre-wɔŋ|
|leopard|bite|monkey-SUF|


'The leopard bites the monkey.'


Past/perfective is not segmentally marked. A marking via tones is probable.

| | | | |
| | | | |
|Dji|di|djre|toro|
|leopard|eat|monkey|yesterday|


'The leopard ate the monkey yesterday.'


Overt segmental marking of TAM or negation changes the word order from SVO to SAuxVO. This can trigger suffixation on the undergoer according to unknown criteria.

| | | | | |
| | | | | |
|Dji|**ni**|djre|di-**o**|nga|
|leopard|FUT|monkey|eat-SUF|tomorrow|

'The leopard will eat the monkey tomorrow.'


Negation is complex. It has double exponency and is sensitive to TAM. The preverbal negation markers are _ne_ and _e_ for present and past respectively, while the postverbal marker is _wɛ_


| | | | | |
| | | | | |
|Dji|**ne**|djre|di|**wɛ**|
|leopard|NEG.PRS|eat|monkey|NEG|


'The leopard does not eat the monkey.'



| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
|Dji|**e**|djre|di|toro|**wɛ**|
|leopard|NEG.PAST|eat|monkey|yesterday|NEG|


'The leopard did not eat the monkey yesterday.'



In the future/irrealis, we find preverbal _nɛ mou_ and no postverbal marker. The first one is the same as the one used for the present.


| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
|Dji|**nɛ**|**mou**|djre|di|nga.|
|leopard|NEG.PRES|FUT|monkey|eat|tomorrow|


'The leopard won't eat the monkey tomorrow.'
